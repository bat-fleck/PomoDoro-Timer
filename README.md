# PomoDoro-Timer

Pomodoro is a technique to increase your productivity and to manage time better  
... A goal of the technique is to reduce the impact of internal and external interruptions on focus and flow. 

```
There are six steps in the original technique:
1.Decide on the task to be done.
2.Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).[1]
3.Work on the task.
4.End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.[5]
5.If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.
6. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
